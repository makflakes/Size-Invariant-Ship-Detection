**WARNING** This implementation will not work without the snappy module from ESA SNAP configured


This set of programs runs in the following steps :

-- ShipDetection.py is run first with the path in the program set to the extracted SAR folder. Results are stored in the folder itself.

-- snap.py is run on the individual band results obtained from the ShipDetection.py execution. Snap.py gives us a visual result in the form of a .png file of the required band.

-- ContourDrawing.py is run last. Src image is the path to the Sigma0_VH_ship_bit_msk band image, and the original band image path is set for drawing.
